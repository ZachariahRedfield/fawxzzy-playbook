# Automation Synthesis Vision

## Purpose

This document defines a future-facing **Automation Synthesis** capability track for Playbook.

Automation Synthesis is intentionally positioned as a phased expansion built on Playbook's current strengths (repository intelligence, deterministic verification, and contract-driven remediation), not a replacement for near-term roadmap priorities.

This track should align with the long-term platform layering in `docs/architecture/PLAYBOOK_PLATFORM_ARCHITECTURE.md`, especially session/evidence architecture, repository memory, evidence-linked trust, policy/control-plane approvals, and bounded orchestration.

Control-plane architecture reference: `docs/architecture/PLAYBOOK_CONTROL_PLANE_ARCHITECTURE.md`.

Governed knowledge-consumption architecture reference: `docs/architecture/PLAYBOOK_AUTOMATION_SYNTHESIS_GOVERNED_KNOWLEDGE_CONSUMPTION.md`.

## Problem statement

Engineering teams repeatedly perform recurring operational and repository-maintenance work (triage loops, repetitive remediation flows, recurring CI hygiene, and runbook-based updates).

Without a structured synthesis system, this work is either manual (high toil) or delegated to ad-hoc scripts/agents (high governance risk).

Playbook's opportunity is to convert recurring, reviewable work patterns into governed automations while keeping outputs deterministic, inspectable, and policy-controlled.

## Proposed architecture (future)

Automation Synthesis should follow a staged architecture aligned with Playbook's deterministic operating model:

1. **Trigger ingestion**
   - Receive recurring-work signals from trusted sources.
2. **Pattern classification + template selection**
   - Map incoming triggers to known automation pattern families and approved templates.
3. **Synthesis prompt generation**
   - Build bounded prompt/context packages from templates, contracts, and repository intelligence.
4. **LLM output generation**
   - Generate candidate automation artifacts and execution plans.
5. **Sandbox verification**
   - Run candidate automations in isolated test environments with deterministic checks and evidence capture.
6. **Approval gates**
   - Require explicit policy/owner approval for promotion and mutation boundaries.
7. **Deployment/orchestration**
   - Publish approved automations into orchestration backends through controlled adapters.
8. **Runtime monitoring + rollback**
   - Track production behavior and support fast rollback/deactivation.
9. **Outcome feedback artifacts + governed runtime learning**
   - Convert verified runtime outcomes (including rollback/deactivation events) into provenance-linked, repo-local candidate learning artifacts for human-reviewed promotion paths.

Generated automations are untrusted until verification and approvals pass, and every synthesis decision should remain traceable to session-scoped evidence and approval history.

Outcome-feedback architecture reference: `docs/architecture/PLAYBOOK_OUTCOME_FEEDBACK_AND_AUTOMATION_RUNTIME_LEARNING.md`.


## Governed knowledge-consumption contract

Automation Synthesis is downstream of governed knowledge and must consume approved, inspectable artifacts instead of opaque conversational memory.

Required input constraints:

- trigger classification, template selection, and context packaging must consume approved knowledge artifacts
- candidate vs promoted knowledge classes must remain explicit
- provenance for all synthesis inputs must be inspectable before operationalization

Disallowed input constraints:

- no direct synthesis from raw chat transcripts
- no direct synthesis from opaque prompt memory
- no direct synthesis from unreviewed candidate knowledge
- no undocumented ad-hoc repository inference as automation-grade context

Rule: automation synthesis may only consume governed/promoted knowledge artifacts that are inspectable and provenance-linked.
Rule: candidate knowledge is not automation-grade input until explicit review/promotion.

## Candidate trigger sources

Examples of future trigger sources (non-exhaustive):

- recurring `verify` findings and remediation task patterns
- repeated `plan -> apply` sequences with similar characteristics
- recurring CI failures tied to known governance/rule categories
- approved runbook executions captured as structured events
- documented operational tasks marked as repeatable candidates

All trigger ingestion should remain explicit, auditable, and privacy-aware.

## Pattern and template system

Automation Synthesis should be template-driven, not free-form by default.

Template system expectations:

- versioned template definitions with stable input/output contracts
- pattern classes (for example: docs hygiene, dependency maintenance, governance remediation, release checks)
- required policy metadata (owners, risk level, allowed targets, rollback path)
- deterministic preconditions and postconditions
- machine-readable evidence attachments for review

Pattern/template coverage should expand incrementally as confidence and verification coverage grow.

## Verification and sandbox model

Verification is the trust boundary for synthesized outputs.

Minimum future verification model:

- isolated sandbox execution (filesystem/network/runtime boundaries per policy)
- deterministic contract checks on generated artifacts and execution behavior
- policy conformance checks before any promotion
- reproducible test traces and structured verification reports
- fail-closed behavior when verification is incomplete or ambiguous

No production deployment should occur without passing verification artifacts.

## Orchestration targets

Automation Synthesis should remain backend-agnostic in design.

Potential target categories:

- CI workflow systems
- repository automation runners
- internal job orchestrators/control planes
- scheduled task platforms

Specific vendors may be supported as adapters over time, but vendor lock-in should not be required for the core capability.

## Security model

Security-first constraints should inherit Playbook's existing governance posture:

- generated automation artifacts are untrusted by default
- least-privilege execution scopes and explicit allowed-action boundaries
- policy gates before any privileged mutation or external side effects
- immutable/auditable approval and deployment records
- strong separation between synthesis, verification, and production execution contexts

Automation Synthesis must not bypass `verify -> plan -> apply` controls for repository mutations.

Synthesis approval gates cannot bypass repository mutation policy, required approvals, or fail-closed enforcement defined by the control plane.

## Observability and rollback

Operational confidence depends on deterministic observability and recovery paths.

Future runtime expectations:

- per-automation health, success/failure, and latency metrics
- execution traces linked back to templates, approvals, and deployment revisions
- anomaly/drift detection against expected behavior contracts
- one-step rollback or disable controls for unsafe or degraded automations
- post-incident evidence packages for governance review

## Phased rollout (future roadmap alignment)

1. **Phase A — Signal and taxonomy foundation**
   - Define trigger taxonomy, pattern families, and template contracts.
2. **Phase B — Synthesis + sandbox prototype**
   - Generate candidate automations for narrow low-risk domains and verify in sandboxes.
3. **Phase C — Approval + controlled deployment**
   - Add policy gates and production-safe deployment adapters.
4. **Phase D — Runtime intelligence maturity**
   - Expand observability, rollback reliability, and broader orchestration support.

This rollout is intentionally additive to core Playbook priorities, not a pivot away from repository intelligence and deterministic remediation.


## Platform alignment extensions (directional)

Automation Synthesis should remain downstream of Playbook's deterministic trust stack:

- **Repository memory / longitudinal state:** synthesis quality should improve from recurring repository history, not one-off prompts.
- **Session + evidence layer:** synthesis should consume session-scoped evidence envelopes (trigger context, command lineage, artifacts, findings, approvals) before any memory/promotion path is considered.
- **Evidence graph / trust model:** generated automations should carry evidence links from trigger -> synthesis -> verification -> approval, with provenance preserved for later audits.
- **Policy/control plane:** approval, permission, and execution boundaries should be centrally governed across CLI/CI/API surfaces.
- **Human approval surfaces:** PR checks, CI gates, and future dashboard/API review flows should expose explicit approve/deny transitions.
- **Longitudinal runtime learning:** post-deployment outcomes should feed deterministic learning loops for template refinement and rollback policy tightening via provenance-linked outcome feedback artifacts.
- **Promoted knowledge artifacts:** trigger classification and synthesis template selection should consume promoted/reviewed knowledge artifacts (not raw candidate memory), with lineage preserved.
- **Knowledge query/inspection prerequisite:** synthesis should consume governed knowledge only after deterministic inspection surfaces make candidate/promoted provenance auditable by humans/CI.

Rule: synthesized automation remains untrusted until verification evidence is complete and required approvals pass.
Rule: automation synthesis is a downstream consumer of governed knowledge artifacts and cannot bypass review, policy, or verification gates.
Rule: automation synthesis should consume promoted knowledge only after that knowledge is inspectable and provenance-linked through deterministic query/inspection surfaces.
Rule: synthesis improvement must run through governed outcome feedback loops, not opaque self-modifying behavior.

Rule: verification remains the trust boundary even when synthesis quality, session evidence, or approval history appears strong.

PR review-loop alignment:

- Future synthesized review/remediation flows should inherit PR Review Loop contracts from `docs/architecture/PLAYBOOK_PR_REVIEW_LOOP_ARCHITECTURE.md`.
- Future synthesis context assembly should consume repo longitudinal state contracts from `docs/architecture/PLAYBOOK_REPO_LONGITUDINAL_STATE_AND_KNOWLEDGE_PROMOTION.md`.
- Synthesis pathways cannot bypass review evidence lineage, control-plane mutation-scope policy, or re-verification requirements after candidate mutations.
- PR adapter surfaces (CI comments, checks, future UIs) remain thin transports over one deterministic runtime rather than independent semantics.

Failure mode to avoid: evidence-poor automation that appears successful in isolated runs but lacks policy- and trust-linked runtime lineage.
