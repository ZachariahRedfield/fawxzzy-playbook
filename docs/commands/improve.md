# `playbook improve`

Generate deterministic improvement candidates from repository memory events and compacted learning pipeline signals.

## Usage

```bash
pnpm playbook improve
pnpm playbook improve --json
pnpm playbook improve opportunities --json
pnpm playbook improve commands --json
pnpm playbook improve apply-safe --json
pnpm playbook improve approve <proposal_id> --json
```

## Subcommands

- `improve` — generate candidates, ranked next-best-improvement analysis, and write deterministic artifacts.
- `improve opportunities` — report the highest-leverage next improvement target plus a ranked secondary queue.
- `improve commands` — emit deterministic command-surface improvement recommendations.
- `improve apply-safe` — apply auto-safe proposals only.
- `improve approve <proposal_id>` — apply explicit human approval for governance-gated candidates.

All improve surfaces support side-effect-free `--help` and deterministic JSON failure envelopes for missing/invalid approval inputs.

## Remediation learning loop

When remediation artifacts are present, `playbook improve` converts bounded self-repair outcomes into **candidate-only** suggestions rather than new mutation authority.

Current remediation-derived suggestion classes:

- `threshold_tuning`
- `repair_class_investigation`
- `verify_rule_improvement`
- `fixture_contract_hardening`
- `docs_doctrine_update`

These suggestions preserve provenance back to stable failure signatures, repair classes, recent run IDs, and outcome states so reviewers can trace why a candidate exists before promoting any follow-up work.

Governance constraints:

- Rule: Runtime outcomes may suggest system improvements, but may not mutate doctrine or policy automatically.
- Rule: New remediation-learning candidate families must declare a review tier explicitly when they can influence doctrine, policy, or operator guidance.
- Pattern: Self-repair becomes compounding only when outcomes are distilled back into candidate knowledge.
- Failure Mode: Rich remediation history that never feeds learning becomes a dead-end log.
- Rule: Repeated blocked signatures should generate investigation/tuning candidates instead of widening execution authority.
- Rule: `improve` remains candidate-only; no queue or execution path changes are made by these remediation-learning outputs.

## Thresholds

Candidates are emitted only when both thresholds are met:

- `minimum_recurrence = 3`
- `minimum_confidence = 0.6`

## Text summary sections

- `AUTO-SAFE improvements`
- `CONVERSATIONAL improvements`
- `GOVERNANCE improvements`


## Command proposal fields

Command proposals include deterministic evidence and governance metadata:

- `proposal_id`
- `command_name`
- `issue_type`
- `evidence_count`
- `supporting_runs`
- `average_failure_rate`
- `average_duration_ms`
- `average_confidence_score`
- `proposed_improvement`
- `rationale`
- `confidence_score`
- `gating_tier`
- `blocking_reasons`

## Next best improvement analysis

`playbook improve opportunities` is a report-only MVP that ranks improvement candidates based on architectural leverage, not just surface-level code issues.

Default output answers:

- what seam is the best next target
- why it matters
- what the likely change shape is

Current deterministic heuristic classes:

- duplicated derivation logic
- broad query fanout
- missing invalidation boundary
- repeated recompute loops
- canonical ID inconsistency in derived-state paths

Doctrine alignment:

- Rule: Playbook should rank improvement candidates based on architectural leverage, not just surface-level code issues.
- Pattern: High-value improvement candidates often appear as duplicated derivation, missing invalidation boundaries, or repeated non-canonical data flows.
- Failure Mode: A governed tool that cannot surface the next best improvement remains dependent on manual senior-engineer initiative selection.
