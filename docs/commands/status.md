# `pnpm playbook status`

Deterministic adoption/readiness summary for governed Playbook usage.

## Modes

- `pnpm playbook status proof --json`: deterministic external-consumer bootstrap proof that validates bootstrap/runtime readiness and emits one compact parallel-work brief sourced from `lane-state`, `worker-results`, `docs-consolidation-plan`, and `policy-apply-result`. Protected-doc governance authority still comes from `verify`/`verify --policy`, not from status text alone.
- `pnpm playbook status --json`: repo-level status/adoption summary.
- `pnpm playbook status fleet --json`: fleet-level aggregate readiness summary using connected Observer repos.
- `pnpm playbook status queue --json`: deterministic read-only adoption work-queue from fleet readiness.
- `pnpm playbook status execute --json`: deterministic Codex-ready execution-plan packaging derived from the queue.
- `pnpm playbook status receipt --json`: canonical planned-vs-actual execution receipt derived from queue/plan context plus explicit ingested execution outcomes from `.playbook/execution-outcome-input.json`.
- `pnpm playbook status updated --json`: reconciled updated adoption state derived from prior state plus the canonical execution receipt; writes `.playbook/execution-updated-state.json` through the shared workflow-promotion contract and returns `next_queue`, which is derived downstream from updated-state only.
- `pnpm playbook status proof --json`: deterministic external-consumer bootstrap proof that validates runtime, CLI resolution, initialization, required docs/artifacts, execution state, and governance contract readiness end to end.

If no Observer registry exists, fleet mode falls back to the current repository as a single-repo fleet.

## Interpretation layer

Human-readable and JSON status surfaces now add a derived `interpretation` block that preserves canonical status truth while compressing it into progressive disclosure:

- **Default view**: `state`, `why`, `next_step`
- **Secondary view**: blocker list, reasoning, and lower-priority actions
- **Deep view**: raw-truth field references, artifact paths, diagnostics, and promotion metadata references

Rule: interpretation is derived, not authoritative.

Pattern: Interpretation Layer.
Pattern: Progressive Disclosure.
Pattern: Single Next Action.
Pattern: State → Narrative Compression.
Failure Mode: Building polished summaries before underlying diagnostics and recommendation signals exist leads to attractive but weak UX.

## Human-facing text posture

Default text mode across repo, fleet, queue, execute, receipt, updated, and proof scopes now compresses status into a compact operator brief:

- decision/status
- affected surfaces
- blockers
- next action

The underlying JSON contracts and `.playbook/*` artifacts remain the source of truth for automation and deep inspection.

- Rule: Human surfaces should show decision, action, and why — not raw machine state.
- Pattern: Artifact-rich, brief-thin operator surfaces keep review fast.
- Failure Mode: Making humans parse machine-oriented artifacts slows review and pushes important decisions off the visible surface.

## Repo readiness JSON contract highlights

- `connection_status`: `connected` | `not_connected`
- `playbook_detected`: whether repo has Playbook config/artifact surface
- `governed_artifacts_present`: validation summary for:
  - `.playbook/repo-index.json`
  - `.playbook/repo-graph.json`
  - `.playbook/plan.json`
  - `.playbook/policy-apply-result.json`
- `lifecycle_stage`:
  - `not_connected`
  - `playbook_not_detected`
  - `playbook_detected_index_pending`
  - `indexed_plan_pending`
  - `planned_apply_pending`
  - `ready`
- `fallback_proof_ready`: requires valid `.playbook/repo-graph.json` and `.playbook/plan.json`
- `cross_repo_eligible`: requires valid `.playbook/repo-index.json`
- `blockers[]`: deterministic blocker code/message/next command
- `recommended_next_steps[]`: exact commands to advance stage

Lifecycle note: `plan` and `apply` success states (including no-op success) are expected to persist canonical `.playbook/plan.json` and `.playbook/policy-apply-result.json` artifacts in the active repo root, including `--repo <target>` executions.

## Fleet summary JSON contract highlights

- `total_repos`
- `by_lifecycle_stage`
- `playbook_detected_count`
- `fallback_proof_ready_count`
- `cross_repo_eligible_count`
- `blocker_frequencies[]` with `blocker_code`, `count`, `repo_ids[]`
- `recommended_actions[]` with `command`, `count`, `repo_ids[]`
- `repos_by_priority[]` with deterministic triage order and first next action

## Fleet prioritization logic

Priority order:

1. `repo_not_connected`
2. `playbook_not_detected`
3. `index_pending`
4. `plan_pending`
5. `apply_pending`
6. `ready`

Within a priority stage, repos are sorted by blocker severity, then `repo_id` to keep output stable and deterministic.

## Adoption work-queue JSON contract highlights

- `kind`: `fleet-adoption-work-queue`
- `generated_at`: queue generation timestamp
- `total_repos`
- `work_items[]`:
  - `repo_id`, `lifecycle_stage`, `blocker_codes[]`
  - `recommended_command`, `priority_stage`, `severity`
  - `parallel_group`, `dependencies[]`, `rationale`, `wave`
- `waves[]`: deterministic wave allocation (`wave_1`, `wave_2`) with repo/action counts
- `queue_source`: `readiness` for readiness-driven queue generation or `updated_state` for post-execution next-queue derivation
- `grouped_actions[]`: parallel-safe lanes (`init lane`, `index lane`, `verify/plan lane`, `apply lane`)
- `blocked_items[]`: items with unmet dependencies
- updated-state-derived `work_items[]` additionally preserve `next_action` and `prompt_lineage[]` so retry/replan routing stays deterministic

## Queue wave and grouping logic

- **Wave 1**: work items with no dependencies beyond current observed state.
- **Wave 2**: work items unlocked only after prerequisite items complete.
- Grouping remains action/lane specific so operators can run similar commands in parallel without violating deterministic dependency order.

Playbook notes:

- **Rule**: Work-queue ordering must be deterministic; identical readiness input produces identical queue output.
- **Pattern**: Use lifecycle-derived action lanes (`init` → `index` → `verify/plan` → `apply`) to scale parallel execution safely.
- **Failure Mode**: Queue drift occurs when operators collapse lane boundaries and execute dependent actions out of order.

## Lifecycle producers

- Detect Playbook: `pnpm playbook init`
- Index stage: `pnpm playbook index --json`
- Plan stage: `pnpm playbook verify --json && pnpm playbook plan --json`
- Apply stage: `pnpm playbook apply --json`

## Examples

```bash
pnpm playbook status --json
pnpm playbook status
pnpm playbook status fleet --json
pnpm playbook status queue --json
pnpm playbook status execute --json
pnpm playbook status receipt --json
```

## Codex execution-plan JSON contract highlights

- `kind`: `fleet-adoption-codex-execution-plan`
- `generated_at` and stable `source_queue_digest`
- `waves[]` with:
  - `wave_id`, `purpose`, `repos[]`, `worker_lanes[]`, `completion_criteria`
- `worker_lanes[]` with:
  - `lane_id`, `wave`, `recommended_command_family`, `repo_ids[]`, `dependencies[]`
  - `parallel_safe`, `merge_conflict_risk`, `rationale`
- `codex_prompts[]` with:
  - `prompt_id`, `wave`, `lane_id`, `repo_id`, `objective`
  - `implementation_plan[]`, `files_to_modify[]`, `verification_steps[]`, `documentation_updates[]`
  - explicit `governance_notes.rules[]`, `governance_notes.patterns[]`, `governance_notes.failure_modes[]`
  - `prompt` copy-paste text
- `execution_notes[]` and `blocked_followups[]`

Execution packaging rules:

- **Wave 1** includes only zero-dependency queue items.
- **Wave 2** includes items unlocked directly by Wave 1 completion.
- Remaining deeper dependency-chain items stay in `blocked_followups[]` until prior waves complete.
- Worker lanes are command-family homogeneous to keep PRs small and minimize merge overlap.

Canonical ordering comparator:

- Lanes are ordered by lifecycle progression: `connect lane` -> `init lane` -> `index lane` -> `verify/plan lane` -> `apply lane`.
- Prompts are ordered by: `wave` -> lane lifecycle priority -> `repo_id` -> `item_id`.
- Wave `worker_lanes[]` use the same lane lifecycle priority ordering.

## Parallel Codex usage guidance

1. Use `status execute --json` and dispatch one `codex_prompts[]` entry per worker.
2. Keep workers lane-scoped and repo-scoped; do not mix command families in one PR.
3. Start with Wave 1 prompts only; generate a fresh execution plan after Wave 1 merges.
4. Use `merge_conflict_risk` and lane rationale to schedule high-risk apply work last.


## Thin execution bridge

`playbook execute --worker-adapter <command> --json` is the narrow execution bridge from deterministic adoption prompts into the canonical feedback loop.

- Playbook derives the same deterministic execution packaging used by `status execute --json`.
- Each prompt is sent to the external adapter over stdin as a small JSON envelope (`repo_id`, `prompt_id`, `lane_id`, `wave`, `objective`, `implementation_plan`, `verification_steps`, `documentation_updates`).
- The adapter must return one JSON object per invocation with the canonical minimum result shape: `repo_id`, `prompt_id`, `status`, optional `observed_transition`, and optional `error`.
- Playbook writes only `.playbook/execution-outcome-input.json`, then reuses the existing receipt/update flow to produce receipt, updated-state, and next-queue outputs.

Governance notes:

- **Rule**: There is only one truth path for execution feedback: execution outcome -> receipt -> updated-state -> next-queue.
- **Pattern**: Use a thin execution bridge that writes canonical outcome artifacts instead of adding a second control path.
- **Failure Mode**: Helper execution flows that bypass canonical receipt/update ingestion fragment system truth and break deterministic governance.

## Execution receipt JSON contract highlights

- `kind`: `fleet-adoption-execution-receipt`
- `execution_plan_digest`: stable digest of the execution plan being evaluated
- `session_id`: operator/session identifier from ingested outcome input
- `wave_results[]`: latest wave result, completed/failed/partial prompts, retry repos, and drift markers
- `prompt_results[]`: one entry per planned prompt with `intended_transition`, `observed_transition`, `status`, `verification_passed`, and evidence
- `repo_results[]`: repo-level aggregate outcome with retry recommendation
- `artifact_deltas[]`: governed artifact evidence tied to lifecycle proof
- `blockers[]`: explicit operator-ingested blockers with evidence
- `verification_summary`: counts plus `repos_needing_retry[]` and `planned_vs_actual_drift[]`

### Planned vs actual semantics

- **Planned lifecycle move** is derived from the queue/execution-plan lane.
- **Observed lifecycle move** is derived from current readiness artifacts after execution.
- **Success** requires both a successful ingested prompt outcome and governed evidence that the repo reached the planned lifecycle target.
- **Mismatch** occurs when the operator-reported result says success but governed lifecycle evidence does not match the planned target.
- **Partial success** captures incomplete forward progress without full target completion.

Governance notes:

- **Rule**: Prefer governed artifact evidence over operator claims when proving lifecycle transitions.
- **Pattern**: Reuse readiness + queue + execution plan instead of inventing a separate outcome reasoner.
- **Failure Mode**: Retry drift occurs when failed or mismatched prompts are not surfaced back into the next queue.

## Planned vs actual lifecycle chain

Use the following deterministic chain without inventing a second outcome model:

1. **Execution plan** (`status execute`) is the operator/worker packaging artifact.
2. **Execution receipt** (`status receipt`) is the canonical planned-vs-actual contract, and its observed outcomes come only from explicit execution ingestion.
3. **Updated state** (`status updated`) reconciles prior readiness + queue + plan + receipt into the next canonical adoption state.

Updated state separates **observed reconciliation outcome** from **derived next-action metadata**.

Observed `reconciliation_status` values are:

- `completed_as_planned`
- `completed_with_drift`
- `partial`
- `failed`
- `blocked`
- `not_run`
- `stale_plan_or_superseded`

Each repo also carries `action_state` booleans:

- `needs_retry`
- `needs_replan`
- `needs_review`

Summary aggregation keeps observed outcome counts (`by_reconciliation_status`) separate from follow-up routing counts (`action_counts`). In particular, `completed_with_drift` is a successful observed outcome class and does **not** automatically imply retry.

## Workflow promotion metadata

`status updated --json` now returns a normalized `promotion` receipt using the shared workflow-promotion contract.

Fields include:

- `workflow_kind`: `status-updated`
- `candidate_artifact_path`: `.playbook/staged/workflow-status-updated/execution-updated-state.json`
- `committed_target_path`: `.playbook/execution-updated-state.json`
- `validation_status` / `promotion_status`
- `blocked_reason` / `error_summary` when promotion is blocked
- `committed_state_preserved` when prior committed state remains intact

Backward-compatible aliases remain available for existing consumers: `staged_artifact_path`, `validation_passed`, and `promoted`.

## Updated-state-driven next queue

Once `.playbook/execution-updated-state.json` exists, that artifact becomes the single source of truth for the next adoption queue. Playbook now derives retry/replan routing from updated-state instead of re-reading raw execution receipts or recomputing directly from readiness.

Deterministic mapping:

- `partial` -> `retry`
- `failed` -> `retry`
- `not_run` -> `retry`
- `blocked` -> remain blocked / no automatic retry
- `stale_plan_or_superseded` -> `replan`
- `completed_with_drift` -> no retry; review-only signal

Control-loop pattern:

`state -> queue -> execution plan -> execution receipt -> updated state -> next queue`

Canonical next-queue ordering comparator:

1. reconciliation priority: `failed` -> `partial` -> `not_run` -> `stale_plan_or_superseded`
2. derived next action: `retry` -> `replan`
3. originating wave: `wave_1` -> `wave_2`
4. `repo_id`

This keeps queue priority explicit and deterministic without relying on incidental object/array insertion order.

Playbook notes:

- **Rule**: Do not derive next actions from raw receipt once updated-state exists.
- **Pattern**: Updated-state is the canonical driver for the next adoption work queue.
- **Failure Mode**: Deriving queue from both readiness and updated-state creates split-brain control flow and nondeterministic execution loops.

## Bootstrap proof (`status proof`)

`pnpm playbook status proof --json` is the first-class external-consumer bootstrap proof flow. It is read-only and deterministic: it does not write repo artifacts, and it classifies the first failing bootstrap stage before returning the single highest-priority next action.

Stages are evaluated in order:

1. `runtime`: Node/pnpm availability
2. `cli`: local Playbook CLI resolution via `pnpm exec playbook --version`
3. `initialization`: Playbook config/bootstrap presence
4. `docs`: required bootstrap docs (`ARCHITECTURE`, `CHANGELOG`, `PLAYBOOK_CHECKLIST`, `PLAYBOOK_NOTES`)
5. `artifacts`: `.playbook/repo-index.json`, `.playbook/repo-graph.json`, `.playbook/plan.json`
6. `execution-state`: `.playbook/policy-apply-result.json` and any already-enforced runtime state such as `.playbook/last-run.json` when governance requires it
7. `governance`: governed `verify` contract checks


JSON proof output preserves the canonical `proof` object and may also include additive `interpretation` metadata when Playbook is intentionally exposing the same `state` / `why` / `next_step` narrative layer used by other user-facing status surfaces.
`status proof --json` now also emits deterministic failure-domain ownership fields derived from existing classification signals:

- `failureDomains[]`
- `primaryFailureDomain`
- `domainBlockers[]`
- `domainNextActions[]`

Canonical domain values are ownership-aware and align with control-loop doctrine:

- `contract_validation`
- `runtime_execution`
- `ci_bootstrap`
- `sync_drift`
- `governance_planning`

Pattern:

- Interpretation-layer metadata may be additive to raw deterministic truth, but must remain explicitly governed.

Rule:

- JSON automation contracts should distinguish required truth fields from additive interpretation metadata.

Failure Mode:

- Exact deep-equality tests on additive command contracts cause false-negative CI failures after intentional metadata growth.

Failure categories are explicit and machine-readable:

- `runtime_unavailable`
- `binary_resolution_failed`
- `repo_not_initialized`
- `required_docs_missing`
- `required_artifacts_missing`
- `execution_state_missing`
- `governance_contract_failed`

Human output for `status proof` now compresses parallel-work integration into one operator brief and emits only:

1. decision / status
2. primary failure domain
3. blocker summary
4. next action
5. compact counts for `pending`, `blocked`, `plan_ready`, `guard_conflicted`, and `merge_ready`
6. compact mutation-scope drift summary (`present`, `missing`, `violated`, `clean`, `budget`, `violated_files`)

The text brief intentionally omits the prior proof `why` narrative and artifact reference list so the operator view stays shorter than raw lane-state details.

The brief reads from existing governed artifacts only:

- `.playbook/lane-state.json`
- `.playbook/worker-results.json`
- `.playbook/docs-consolidation-plan.json`
- `.playbook/policy-apply-result.json`
- `.playbook/execution-outcome-input.json` (when present for declared-vs-actual mutation scope evidence)

It does **not** create a new state store. Full detail stays in JSON output and the underlying `.playbook/*` artifacts.

`parallel_work.scope` (additive JSON fields) now reports:

- `present`: prompt outcomes with explicit `mutation_scope`
- `missing`: prompt outcomes without `mutation_scope`
- `violated`: prompts where actual mutated files were out-of-scope or exceeded budget
- `clean`: prompts with explicit scope and no violation
- `violated_files[]`: unique out-of-scope files
- `budget_status`: `within_budget` | `over_budget` | `unknown`
- `blockers[]` in the compact summary is normalized (trimmed, empty/whitespace-only entries removed, deterministic ordering preserved)

Rule:

- A tooling migration is incomplete until the repo can both run Playbook and satisfy its enforced artifact/governance bootstrap contract.

Pattern:

- External consumer bootstrap proof should verify runtime, governance artifacts, and execution state in one deterministic flow.

Failure Mode:

- A repo can appear integrated because commands exist locally while still failing as a real governed consumer due to missing runtime/artifact/bootstrap guarantees.
- When status/proof hides domain ownership, operators and AI can choose the wrong repair lane even when raw diagnostics are present.

Rule:

- Failure classification must reflect ownership, not just symptom location.

Pattern:

- Classify domain -> surface blocker -> route next action.
