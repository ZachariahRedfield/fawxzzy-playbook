# `pnpm playbook test-triage`

Parse captured Vitest, pnpm recursive failure output, and GitHub Actions annotation lines into a deterministic failure-summary artifact.

Rule: Any Playbook-managed CI/test failure must emit both raw output and a deterministic normalized summary.

Pattern: Failure summarization is a contract surface, not a convenience logger.

Failure Mode: Raw stderr alone creates re-interpretation work and slows remediation across repeated CI loops.

## Usage

```bash
pnpm playbook test-triage --input .playbook/ci-failure.log
pnpm playbook test-triage --input .playbook/ci-failure.log --json
pnpm playbook schema test-triage --json
```

## Scope and governance boundary

`test-triage` is diagnosis-first automation.

- It parses repeated CI failure shapes into deterministic repair classes.
- It emits the smallest rerun commands first.
- It generates repair planning guidance and a Codex-ready prompt for low-risk test-only classes.
- It can feed a first-class `test-fix-plan` artifact that turns only pre-approved low-risk findings into apply-compatible remediation tasks.
- It does **not** auto-edit production logic in this first slice.
- It preserves the governance boundary: diagnosis first, repair planning second, and no blind merge-time mutation.

Rule: Automate diagnosis first, repair second, merge never.

Pattern: Most repeated CI failures cluster into a small set of deterministic repair classes that can be parsed from test output.

Failure Mode: Teams waste time manually re-deriving the same failure classification logic instead of encoding it as reusable automation.

## Fixture isolation lesson

Stabilizing contract snapshot tests exposed a reusable architecture lesson: isolated fixtures surfaced producer/consumer dependencies that shared fixture state had been masking. `test-triage` exists to classify that kind of failure deterministically before any repair path is chosen.

- Rule: isolated contract fixtures force hidden producer/consumer dependencies into the open.
- Pattern: contract snapshots work best when every consumer command declares its prerequisite artifact producers explicitly.
- Failure Mode: shared fixture state makes snapshots look stable while silently depending on prior command side effects.

## Supported deterministic classes

- `snapshot_drift`
- `stale_assertion`
- `fixture_drift`
- `ordering_drift`
- `missing_artifact`
- `environment_limitation`
- `likely_regression`
- `missing_expected_finding`
- `contract_drift`
- `test_expectation_drift`
- `lint_failure`
- `typecheck_failure`
- `runtime_failure`
- `recursive_workspace_failure`

Low-risk classes are marked `autofix_plan_only`.
Riskier classes are marked `review_required`.

## Output contract

JSON output includes:

- `status`, `summary`, and `primaryFailureClass` for summary-first CI surfaces
- `failures[]` / `findings[]` with `failure_kind`, `confidence`, `package`, `test_file`, `test_name`, and parsed GitHub annotations
- `likely_files_to_modify`
- `suggested_fix_strategy`
- `verification_commands`
- `docs_update_recommendation`
- `rule_pattern_failure_mode`
- `repair_class`
- `rerun_plan.commands` in file → package → workspace order
- `repair_plan.summary`
- `repair_plan.codex_prompt`

Use `pnpm playbook schema test-triage --json` to inspect the stable machine-readable envelope.

## Follow-on `test-fix-plan` contract

`test-fix-plan` is the bounded remediation artifact derived from `test-triage`.

- It preserves triage provenance for every executable task.
- It only emits apply-compatible tasks for four approved low-risk classes: snapshot refresh, stale assertion update, fixture normalization, and deterministic ordering stabilization.
- It excludes risky or unsupported findings with explicit reasons instead of manufacturing speculative edits.
- Task entries retain the standard `id`, `ruleId`, `file`, `action`, and `autoFix` fields so existing plan/apply machinery can consume them deterministically.

Rule: diagnosis artifacts may only produce executable tasks for pre-approved low-risk repair classes.

Pattern: convert parsed failure classes into explicit bounded plan tasks before any mutation step.

Failure Mode: parsing CI logs directly into code edits bypasses the remediation trust boundary and makes automation untrustworthy.
