# `pnpm playbook memory`

Inspect and review repository memory artifacts using thin, deterministic CLI surfaces.

## Subcommands

### `memory events`

List episodic events from `.playbook/memory/events` with optional filters (`--module`, `--rule`, `--fingerprint`, `--limit`, `--order`).

### `memory query`

Query normalized repository memory events with deterministic filtering and ordering.

Supported normalized filters:

- `--event-type`
- `--subsystem`
- `--run-id`
- `--subject`
- `--related-artifact`
- `--order`
- `--limit`

Summary views:

- `--view recent-routes`
- `--view lane-transitions --run-id <id>`
- `--view worker-assignments --run-id <id>`
- `--view artifact-improvements --related-artifact <path>`

### `memory candidates`

List replay candidates from `.playbook/memory/replay-candidates.json` (compat-written to `.playbook/memory/candidates.json`) for operator review.

Replay output remains candidate-only and is derived from memory evidence in `.playbook/memory/index.json` plus append-only event records under `.playbook/memory/events/*.json`; it does not read opaque raw logs directly.

Operator note: postmortem reconsolidation should enter here as a reviewed artifact flow — write the structured postmortem first, extract explicit candidates from that artifact, then review them through `memory` / `promote` surfaces without introducing a new command family or automatic promotion.

Retrieval review for promoted knowledge/doc recall remains on the `knowledge` family via `pnpm playbook knowledge review ...` and `pnpm playbook knowledge review record ...`; `memory` remains the lifecycle/promotion surface.

### `memory knowledge`

List promoted knowledge artifacts from `.playbook/memory/knowledge/*.json`.

Consolidation lives alongside this surface as `.playbook/memory/consolidation-candidates.json`: it summarizes replay candidates, preserves event/replay provenance, and keeps promotion explicit with `reviewRequired: true` instead of auto-promoting doctrine.

### `memory compaction`

Materialize and review `.playbook/memory/compaction-review.json`, a read-only review artifact that exposes deterministic compaction bucket decisions across replay, consolidation, and promotion depth.

Bucket decisions are first-class and filterable with `--decision`:

- `discard`
- `attach`
- `merge`
- `new_candidate`

Each entry includes canonical `reasonCodes`, replay/consolidation/event provenance, matched promoted knowledge provenance when present, and explicit review-only promotion metadata (`explicitOnly: true`, `reviewRequired: true`). This surface does **not** widen mutation authority and does **not** auto-promote doctrine.

### `memory pressure`

Inspect read-only memory pressure artifacts from:

- `.playbook/memory-pressure.json`
- `.playbook/memory-pressure-plan.json`

This command is inspection-only and does **not** add mutation paths.

Text output stays thin (`band@score` + action count). JSON keeps full detail and includes:

- score
- band
- hysteresis thresholds
- usage totals
- retention class summary
- ordered recommended actions from the current (or filtered) plan band

Lightweight filters:

- `--band normal|warm|pressure|critical`
- `--action dedupe|compact|summarize|evict`

### `memory show <id>`

Show one memory candidate or promoted knowledge entry by id.

- Candidate responses include expanded event provenance when available.
- Knowledge responses preserve retirement/supersession state.

### `memory promote <candidate-id>`

Promote a reviewed replay candidate into local semantic memory artifacts:

- `.playbook/memory/knowledge/decisions.json`
- `.playbook/memory/knowledge/patterns.json`
- `.playbook/memory/knowledge/failure-modes.json`
- `.playbook/memory/knowledge/invariants.json`

Promotion remains explicit and reviewed: replay/consolidation artifacts never mutate knowledge automatically.

### `memory retire <knowledge-id>`

Retire an existing promoted knowledge record without deleting provenance.

## Guarantees

- Pattern: **Fast Episodic Store, Slow Doctrine Store**.
- Rule: **Working Memory Is Not Doctrine**.
- Rule: **Retrieval Must Return Provenance**.
- Failure Mode: **Memory Hoarding**.

## Retention classes (canonical policy inputs)

Pressure-control and compaction policy should classify memory artifacts into one of three classes:

| Class | Definition | Expected handling | Examples |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `canonical` | Repository truth or audited policy/governance outputs that must remain stable and inspectable. | Never dropped by memory-pressure routines. Mutations only through canonical command boundaries. | `.playbook/repo-index.json`, `.playbook/repo-graph.json`, `.playbook/plan.json`, `.playbook/policy-apply-result.json`, `.playbook/policy-evaluation.json`, promoted knowledge under `.playbook/memory/knowledge/*.json`. |
| `compactable` | Valuable temporal evidence that should be reduced/summarized, not discarded first. | Prefer deterministic compaction (bucket/rewrite/attach/merge) before disposal. | `.playbook/memory/events/*.json`, `.playbook/memory/index.json`, `.playbook/memory/replay-candidates.json`, `.playbook/memory/consolidation-candidates.json`, `.playbook/memory/compaction-review.json`, `.playbook/memory/lifecycle-candidates.json`, `.playbook/test-autofix-history.json`. |
| `disposable` | Rebuildable, transient, or transport-local artifacts that do not carry canonical truth. | May be evicted first under pressure when not needed for active review/audit. | local temp/debug exports, intermediate CI transport snapshots, and one-off scratch artifacts outside canonical `.playbook/` contracts. |

Policy boundary notes:

- Structural intelligence (`repo-index`, `repo-graph`) stays canonical and is not temporal memory.
- Candidate/review artifacts remain non-doctrine until explicit promotion.
- This classification does **not** widen mutation authority; canonical remediation and promotion boundaries are unchanged.

## Memory pressure inspection (read-only)

`pnpm playbook status` includes additive memory-pressure inspection fields and points to the read-only artifacts `.playbook/memory-pressure.json` and `.playbook/memory-pressure-plan.json`.

Inspection payload includes:

- current pressure score and band
- hysteresis thresholds (`warm`, `pressure`, `critical`, and `hysteresis`)
- current usage totals (`usedBytes`, `fileCount`, `eventCount`)
- recommended actions already selected by the current pressure band
- action-plan summary from `.playbook/memory-pressure-plan.json`:
  - `current_band`
  - `highest_priority_recommended_actions` (compact top actions)
  - `counts_by_action_type` (`dedupe`, `compact`, `summarize`, `evict`)
- deterministic proposal-only action lanes by band (`warm`, `pressure`, `critical`) that sequence dedupe/compact/summarize/evict without automatic sweeping

### Pressure-band operator matrix (engine-aligned)

| Band | Intake behavior | Compaction behavior | Summarization behavior | Eviction eligibility |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `normal` | Admit by default; canonical/review-critical always admitted. | No pressure-lane compaction requirement. | None required by pressure plan. | None (no pressure eviction lane). |
| `warm` | Keep admitting, but dedupe repeated low-signal duplicates at intake. | Increase compaction cadence across compactable/disposable targets (proposal-only plan lane). | Not required in warm lane. | Not eligible in warm lane. |
| `pressure` | Low-signal repeats shift to rollups; other eligible events still admit. | Compact after summarize to preserve signal under budget (proposal-only lane). | Summarize low-signal runtime detail into deterministic rollups. | Not eligible in pressure lane. |
| `critical` | Strict gate: admit canonical, review-critical, or high-signal; skip low-value events. | Aggressive compaction across non-canonical classes (proposal-only lane). | Required before any disposable eviction is proposed. | Proposal-only and disposable-only, after summary requirement is satisfied; canonical is excluded. |

Governance framing:

- Rule: **Canonical governance artifacts are preserved; everything else earns retention under pressure.**
- Rule: **Pressure policy should shape intake before it starts deleting history.**
- Pattern: **Inspect first, then tighten intake, then plan compaction.**
- Failure Mode: **Read-only pressure status is informative but not useful if intake behavior never changes.**
