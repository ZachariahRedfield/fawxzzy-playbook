# Playbook Development Execution System v1

## 1. Executive decisions

1. **Command ownership converges into engine now**: every product command has one canonical implementation in `@zachariahredfield/playbook-engine`; CLI handlers become argument parsing + output adapters only.
2. **`analyze` becomes a compatibility composition command**: keep first-class UX, but route execution through engine-owned intelligence + governance pipeline. No separate duplicate logic.
3. **`graph` evolves (not replaced)** into the **Architecture Intelligence Graph** surface, with `graph` as stable entrypoint and optional `graph <subcommand>` family in v0.7.
4. **`verify` is the quality gate kernel**: governance rules, roadmap compliance, contract drift, docs audit integration all flow through deterministic verify profiles.
5. **Roadmap contract is mandatory for all feature work**: no roadmap item, no feature.
6. **Failure Intelligence Loop is promoted to roadmap feature** and is required to prevent repeat uncodified failures.

## 2. Canonical command model

| Command | Purpose | Canonical owner | Lifecycle | De-duplication strategy |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `analyze` | Top-level repository health summary | engine | compatibility-stable | Compose `index/query + verify + docs/audit` in engine; CLI wrapper only |
| `verify` | Deterministic governance and release gates | engine | stable | Single rule runtime; command-specific checks become plugins |
| `plan` | Deterministic remediation plan from findings | engine | stable | Reads normalized finding contract only |
| `apply` | Deterministic autofix execution | engine | stable | Executes engine plan tasks only |
| `index` | Build intelligence artifacts | engine/node | stable | Owns all artifact generation; no side generators |
| `graph` | Architecture intelligence graph output/exploration | engine/node | stable->extended | Keep base `graph`; add subcommands in v0.7 (`graph impact`, `graph boundaries`) |
| `query` | Structured reads from intelligence artifacts | engine | stable | Strict query domains; no narrative output |
| `ask` | Natural-language Q&A over indexed intelligence | engine | stable | Uses `query` backplane; no direct file inference by default |
| `explain` | Deterministic explanations for architecture/rules/modules | engine | stable | Uses graph + rule metadata; avoids `ask` overlap by template-backed explainers |
| `analyze-pr` | Deterministic change-risk/impact analysis | engine/node | stable | Must consume shared SCM context + architecture graph only |

## 3. Package boundary and plugin convergence plan

### Target ownership map
- `@fawxzzy/playbook` (CLI): command registration, args/options parsing, output rendering, exit codes.
- `@zachariahredfield/playbook-engine`: canonical command handlers, orchestration, plugin lifecycle, contracts.
- `@zachariahredfield/playbook-core`: pure domain models, schema/types, rule abstractions, taxonomy primitives.
- `@zachariahredfield/playbook-node`: filesystem/scm/process adapters and platform I/O.

### Migration sequence
1. Create engine command registry (`commandId -> handler`) and route CLI wrappers to it.
2. Move `analyze` orchestration into engine composition handler.
3. Move plugin loading into one engine plugin manager.
4. Delete duplicated loaders/wrappers after contract parity tests pass.

### Anti-patterns to eliminate
- Command logic in CLI package.
- Duplicate plugin registration paths per command.
- Commands reading raw git/filesystem without node adapter.
- Contract schema definitions duplicated across docs/tests/runtime.

## 4. Shared SCM context normalization system

### Ownership
- Primary: `playbook-node` (`scm/context.ts`)
- Contracts/types: `playbook-core`
- Consumers: `playbook-engine` commands (`analyze-pr`, `ask --diff-context`, diff-aware `verify` checks)

### API shape
```ts
interface ScmContext {
  repoRoot: string;
  headSha: string;
  baseSha: string | null;
  mode: 'branch' | 'detached-head' | 'shallow' | 'merge-commit';
  changedFiles: ChangedFile[];
  renameMap: Array<{ from: string; to: string; similarity: number }>;
  diagnostics: ScmDiagnostic[];
}
```

### Migration order
1. Build provider + fixtures.
2. Migrate `analyze-pr` first.
3. Migrate `ask --diff-context`.
4. Migrate diff-aware `verify` rules.

### Required edge-case matrix
- detached HEAD
- shallow clone missing merge base
- rename-heavy diffs (`Rxx`)
- deleted file dependencies
- submodule pointer changes
- dirty working tree + staged-only mode

## 5. Roadmap execution system

- Keep canonical machine roadmap in `docs/roadmap/ROADMAP.json`.
- Enforce schema with `scripts/validate-roadmap-contract.mjs`.
- Add `playbook roadmap verify` as CLI alias over the script in v1.0.
- PR template must include `Roadmap-ID: PB-V...`.
- CI checks:
  - roadmap contract valid
  - PR references at least one roadmap ID
  - touched command/docs/contracts map to roadmap entry.
- Merge automation updates roadmap item status (`planned -> in-progress -> implemented-hardening`) and appends release note fragment.

## 6. Contract / docs / tests enforcement model

### Blocking in sprint
- command JSON output changed without contract update.
- command behavior changed without tests.
- roadmap ID missing in PR.
- plugin registry parity checks failing.
- SCM normalization contract failures for diff-aware commands.

### Warning-only in sprint
- docs prose improvements outside touched command scope.
- non-critical architecture note drift.

### Contract change checklist
1. Update command contract spec (`docs/contracts/*`).
2. Update schema/snapshot tests.
3. Update command docs page.
4. Update roadmap item `contracts/tests/docs` references if new files added.
5. Run command verification suite.

## 7. Roadmap feature: Failure Intelligence Loop

- **feature_id**: `PB-V06-FAILURE-INTELLIGENCE-001`
- **version**: `v0.6`
- **goal**: convert incidents into codified prevention artifacts.
- **command surface**: `failure ingest`, `failure classify`, `failure suggest`, `failure scaffold` (scaffold in v0.6.1).
- **ownership**: engine + core + CLI.
- **taxonomy example**:
  - `contract-drift`
  - `boundary-violation`
  - `scm-nondeterminism`
  - `docs-sync-gap`
  - `rule-gap-repeat`
- **prevention-target mapping**: `taxonomy -> {rule_template, test_template, doc_target, command_guard}`.
- **generated outputs**: failure reports in `.playbook/failures/*.json`, suggestion bundle, optional scaffold patches.
- **prevention guarantee**: each closed failure requires linked prevention target IDs; CI blocks unresolved "codification_required" failures.

## 8. Roadmap feature: Architecture Intelligence Graph

- **feature_id**: `PB-V07-ARCH-INTELLIGENCE-GRAPH-001`
- **version**: `v0.7`
- **goal**: semantic graph as reusable reasoning substrate.
- **relationship**: supersedes current repo graph schema while preserving compatibility export.
- **command surface**: existing `graph` plus `graph impact`, `graph boundaries`, `graph risks`.
- **ownership**: engine/node with core graph contracts.
- **artifacts**:
  - `.playbook/repo-index.json` (entity index)
  - `.playbook/repo-graph.json` (compat view)
  - `.playbook/arch-graph.v2.json` (semantic graph canonical)
- **incremental updates**: file-hash based invalidation + SCM diff deltas.
- **self-analysis**: Playbook uses arch graph to detect boundary violations and PR risk scoring.

## 9. Gate strategy for 4-week sprint

| Gate | Policy |
| --- | --- |
| Roadmap validation | hard-fail |
| Docs audit for touched command docs/contracts | hard-fail |
| Contract/snapshot changes | hard-fail |
| Plugin registry checks | hard-fail |
| SCM normalization checks | hard-fail for diff-aware commands |
| Governance note drift not tied to touched scope | warning |
| Architecture boundary checks | warning week 1, hard-fail weeks 2-4 |

## 10. 4-week implementation sequence

### Week 0 (pre-sprint stabilization)
- Freeze command ownership RFC and roadmap contract field set.
- Implement package_ownership enforcement and PR Roadmap-ID policy.
- Exit: CI enforces roadmap schema and PR linkage.

### Week 1
- Implement unified engine command/plugin registry.
- Migrate `analyze` to composition handler.
- Exit: no command business logic remains in CLI.

### Week 2
- Deliver shared SCM normalization module + fixtures.
- Migrate `analyze-pr` and diff-aware ask path.
- Exit: analyze-pr deterministic across edge-case fixtures.

### Week 3
- Implement Failure Intelligence Loop v1 (`ingest/classify/suggest`).
