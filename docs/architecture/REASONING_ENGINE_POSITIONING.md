# Playbook Reasoning Engine Positioning

## Positioning statement

Playbook is evolving from a repository intelligence and governance CLI into a deterministic reasoning engine for engineering knowledge formation, compression, governance, and self-improvement.

The CLI remains the delivery surface for current users, but the product direction is the reasoning runtime beneath that surface.

## Product framing

Playbook should be understood as:

- a deterministic evidence-processing engine
- a knowledge lifecycle orchestrator
- a governance runtime that emits operational contracts
- a self-improving system that can inspect and tune its own reasoning pathways

This framing preserves current CLI value while clarifying why architecture investments are focused on memory, promotion decisions, transforms, and doctrine quality.

## Current knowledge lifecycle

Canonical lifecycle:

`artifacts -> zettels -> groups -> draft patterns -> promoted patterns -> contracts`

Detailed runtime mapping:

`evidence -> zettels -> graph -> groups -> candidate patterns -> draft pattern cards -> promotion decisions -> contracts`

Lifecycle intent by stage:

- **evidence**: raw deterministic findings from verify/plan/apply/analyze/docs surfaces
- **zettels**: atomized, linked working-memory notes with lineage
- **graph**: typed relational substrate for structural retrieval and traversal
- **groups**: deterministic cohesion formation over graph-connected evidence
- **candidate patterns**: synthesized reusable hypotheses from grouped evidence
- **draft pattern cards**: reviewable, contract-shaped knowledge proposals
- **promotion decisions**: explicit append-only morphisms that change durable state
- **contracts**: enforced doctrine with policy/governance force


## Canonical core vs provisional frontier

Trust is intentionally asymmetric across layers:

- provisional frontier: `artifacts`, `zettels`, `groups`, `draft patterns`
- canonical core: `promoted patterns`, `contracts`

Trust-ladder invariants:

- volume decreases as trust increases
- mutation frequency decreases as trust increases
- review requirements increase as trust increases

Rule:
No knowledge layer may grow in authority faster than it shrinks in volume.

Pattern:
A reasoning engine stays healthy by maintaining a small canonical core and a large provisional frontier.

Failure Mode:
When canonical layers expand too quickly or provisional layers never compress, the system collapses into doctrine thrash or structured clutter.

## Next three defining capabilities

### 1) Meta-Playbook introspection

Playbook should deterministically reason about its own reasoning pipeline.

Implementation direction:

- inspect run-cycle outcomes, promotion quality, and failure recurrence
- identify where compaction, promotion, or transform rules underperform
- generate bounded, reviewable proposals to improve Playbook internals

### 2) Functorial knowledge transforms

Playbook should map validated knowledge across operational domains while preserving invariant structure.

Implementation direction:

- treat transforms as typed functors from pattern-state objects to target contract/doc/CI objects
- make mappings replayable and lineage-complete
- enforce structure-preserving checks before outputs are accepted

### 3) Topology/equivalence compression

Playbook should reduce doctrinal redundancy by collapsing structurally equivalent pattern cards into canonical representatives.

Implementation direction:

- compute deterministic topology signatures from invariant fields
- maintain canonical equivalence classes with variant lineage
- keep one canonical structural idea while preserving audit history

## Novelty and claim boundary

Playbook is not claiming invention of novel raw mathematics.

The novelty is architectural synthesis and deterministic operationalization:

- combining graph memory, promotion morphisms, functor transforms, and topology compression into one production runtime
- grounding these abstractions in deterministic artifacts, contracts, and replayable workflows
- making advanced reasoning patterns implementable in everyday engineering governance

## Engineering guidance

Rule:
Every major subsystem in Playbook must contribute to knowledge formation, compression, governance, or self-reflection.

Pattern:
Playbook's novelty is architectural synthesis, not isolated invention of underlying theory.

Failure Mode:
Treating Playbook as only a tooling layer hides its real product direction and leads to roadmap underreach.
