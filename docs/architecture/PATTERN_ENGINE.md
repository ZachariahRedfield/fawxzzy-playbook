# Pattern Engine

Pattern Engine is the canonical Playbook architecture doctrine for turning repeated evidence into reusable, deterministic pattern knowledge.

It sits between raw evidence and promoted doctrine, and explains how symbol compression, Pattern Convergence, and higher-order reuse should work without introducing hidden causation claims.

## Scope and doctrine boundaries

Pattern Engine aligns to current Playbook doctrine:

- evidence -> compaction -> promoted doctrine
- deterministic contracts over implicit interpretation
- provenance-linked promotion and lifecycle review
- no hidden causation claims from similarity alone

Rule: Stable input signals produce convergent abstractions across independent systems.

Pattern: Signal -> Compression -> Convergence -> Weighted Review -> Explicit Promotion.

Failure Mode: Mistaking convergence for hidden coordination instead of shared constraint.

## Canonical definitions

### Pattern fingerprint

A **pattern fingerprint** is a deterministic, comparable identity for a compacted behavior shape derived from evidence.

A fingerprint should be built from stable fields (inputs, invariant conditions, transform shape, outcome class) so independent runs can compare equivalence without requiring narrative interpretation.

### Convergence cluster

A **convergence cluster** is a bounded set of pattern fingerprints that independently converge on the same governing constraint.

Clusters are evidence groupings, not causation proofs. They indicate repeated structural similarity under shared constraints.

### Higher-order pattern

A **higher-order pattern** is a promoted abstraction built from multiple convergence clusters when they share one reusable invariant boundary.

Higher-order patterns are valid only when provenance remains linked to source clusters and confidence remains explicit.

### Promotion confidence multiplier

A **promotion confidence multiplier** is an explicit weighting factor applied when independent convergence increases trust that a candidate pattern is stable enough for review.

The multiplier can raise review priority, but it does not bypass promotion gates, lifecycle checks, or explicit human/governed acceptance.

Rule: Convergence may raise review priority, but must not bypass promotion gates.

Failure Mode: Treating convergence as automatic truth causes silent authority creep in promotion workflows.

## Implemented now vs future architecture

### Implemented now (current doctrine and command surfaces)

- Evidence capture through deterministic command outputs and artifacts.
- Compaction into reusable Rule / Pattern / Failure Mode candidates with provenance.
- Promotion as an explicit, audited boundary with lifecycle state.
- Advisory-only influence for non-promoted or non-active knowledge.

### Future architecture (Pattern Engine expansion)

- First-class fingerprint registries for deterministic cross-run comparison.
- Convergence cluster contracts with confidence scoring metadata.
- Higher-order pattern synthesis contracts that preserve source provenance.
- Confidence multipliers integrated as explicit policy inputs for promotion review tooling.

These are architecture targets, not claims of current automatic behavior.

Current operator path note: doctrine -> convergence artifact -> patterns convergence review; explicit promotion remains a separate governed boundary.

Review queue weighting note: convergence suggestions are additive, proposal-only metadata attached to review candidates (cluster id, convergence confidence, suggested priority, weighted score, rationale, provenance). Canonical confidence and lifecycle state remain unchanged until explicit promotion.

## Engineering example: singleton docs / shared mutable resource / single-writer boundary

Consider repository documentation where many tools can read, but only one governed command path writes canonical doctrine files.

- **Evidence:** repeated drift findings show duplicate edits to singleton doctrine docs.
- **Compression:** extract invariant: shared mutable resource requires a single-writer boundary.
- **Convergence:** the same invariant appears across docs generation, promotion receipts, and lifecycle state updates.
- **Reuse:** promote a higher-order pattern: “singleton artifact + many readers + one governed writer” as a reusable architecture rule.

This keeps mutation deterministic while allowing broad read/analysis access.

## Why convergence is evidence of shared constraints, not hidden coordination

Independent systems exposed to similar constraints often produce similar abstractions.

Pattern Convergence should therefore be interpreted as evidence that constraints are real and recurring, not as proof that systems are secretly coordinated.

Playbook doctrine remains explicit:

- convergence strengthens confidence in reusable constraints,
- provenance preserves how confidence was earned,
- promotion remains a governed decision boundary,
- and causation claims require direct evidence, not pattern similarity alone.
